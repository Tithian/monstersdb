    "Creating a Skeleton": "\u201cSkeleton\u201d is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).\nSize and Type: The creature\u2019s type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature\u2019s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.\nHit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from class levels (to a minimum of 1) and raise remaining Hit Dice to d12s. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can\u2019t be made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell.\nSpeed: Winged skeletons can\u2019t use their wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton.\nArmor Class: Natural armor bonus changes to a number based on the skeleton\u2019s size:\nAttacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can\u2019t work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A skeleton\u2019s base attack bonus is equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.\nDamage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton\u2019s size. (If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it\u2019s better.)\nSpecial Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base creature\u2019s special attacks.\nSpecial Qualities: A skeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A skeleton gains the following special qualities.\nImmunity to Cold (Ex): Skeletons are not affected by cold.\nDamage Reduction 5/Bludgeoning (Ex): Skeletons lack flesh or internal organs.\nSaves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.\nAbilities: A skeleton\u2019s Dexterity increases by +2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1.\nSkills: A skeleton has no skills.\nFeats: A skeleton loses all feats of the base creature and gains Improved Initiative.\nEnvironment: Any, usually same as base creature.\nOrganization: Any.\nChallenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:\nTreasure: None.\nAlignment: Always neutral evil.\nAdvancement: As base creature (or \u2014 if the base creature advances by character class).\nLevel Adjustment: \u2014.\n"
