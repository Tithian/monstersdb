Severing or destroying all six crowns puts the plant out of commission, allowing excavation of the helpless root. The crowns are Medium objects with a hardness of 5 and 7 hit points. To sever a crown, an opponent must use the sunder action. The crowns can also be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target.An udoroot takes no damage from having a crown severed or destroyed. A severed crown dies and can no longer be used to attack, but the udoroot takes no other penalties. As long as the root system remains intact, the crown regrows in about a month.Double Manifest (Ex): An udoroot senses its surroundings and manifests its psi-like abilities through its crowns. It can manifest two psi-like abilities per round, as long as it has at least two crowns remaining.Psi-Like Abilities: At will\u2014energy stun (electricity, 2d6, DC 15*), false sensor input (DC 15), id insinuation (two targets, DC 15*), mind thrust (ML 4th, 4d10, DC 14*), telekinetic force (275 lb., DC 15*), thought shield (power resistance 16*); 3/day\u2014astral construct (3rd level*), body adjustment, mental barrier.Manifester level 6th.
