These massive creatures are surprisingly gentle. If harassed or provoked, they are as likely to flee as they are to retaliate.Blindsight (Ex): Whales can \u201csee\u201d by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human\u2019s.Hold Breath (Ex): A whale can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 \u00d7 its Constitution score before it risks drowning.Skills: A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A whale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Baleen Whale"}]
