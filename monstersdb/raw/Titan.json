If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan\u2019s Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat, it can use chain lightning as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability at the same time.Prior to combat: Invisibility purge or invisibility.Round 1: Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous foe. Hurl chain lightning at opponents standing away from the fight.Round 2: Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl chain lightning at other opponents.Round 3: Back away from first opponent and use maze or meteor swarm on any spellcaster causing trouble.Round 4: Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use greater dispel magic on all nearby opponents.Round 5: Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use fire storm.Use another quickened chain lightning if foes seem really dangerous.A titan usually reserves its gate and etherealness abilities to escape a fight that is not going well.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Titan"}]
