Conversely, with their own natural grace and agility, satyrs can sneak up on travelers who are not carefully watching the surrounding wilderness. Once engaged in battle, an unarmed satyr attacks with a powerful head butt. A satyr expecting trouble is likely to be armed with a bow and a [[SRD:Dagger (SRD Weapon)|Dagger]] and typically looses arrows from hiding, weakening an enemy before closing.Pipes (Su): Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by charm person, sleep, or fear (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe\u2019s effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.Skills: Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks."}]
