Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground.

A troll\u2019s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray.Trolls speak Giant."}, {"Combate": "Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without hesitation, flailing wildly at the closest opponent. Even when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack.Rend (Ex): If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent\u2019s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.Regeneration (Ex): Fire and acid deal normal damage to a troll. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump."}]
