[{"Nombre": "Nightshade"}, {"Combate": "Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according to their abilities, but they all make liberal use of haste.Nightshade AbilitiesAll Nightshades have the following special abilities.Aversion to Daylight (Ex): If exposed to natural daylight (not merely a daylight spell), Nightshades take a \u20134 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.Desecrating Aura (Su): All Nightshades give off a 20-foot radius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability works much like a desecrate spell, except that the nightshade\u2019s evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a \u20136 penalty.A nightshade\u2019s desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a dispel evil spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade can resume it as a free action on its next turn. Its desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a consecrated or hallowed area, but the nightshade\u2019s presence also suppresses the consecrated or hallowed effect for as long as it remains in the area.List of NightshadesNightcrawlerNightwalkerNightwing"}]
