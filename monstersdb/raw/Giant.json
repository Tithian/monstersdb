[{"Nombre": "Giant"}, {"Descripci\u00f3n": "All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher also speak Common."}, {"Combate": "Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant\u2019s favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.Rock Throwing (Ex): Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the giant\u2019s variety. A Huge giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects).Rock Catching (Ex): A giant of at least Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.List of GiantsCloud GiantFire GiantFrost GiantFrost Giant JarlHill GiantHill Giant Dire WereboarStone GiantStone Giant ElderStorm GiantSee Wikipedia Entry: Giant"}]
