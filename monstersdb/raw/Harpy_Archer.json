Harpy archers often become mercenaries, selling their services to the highest bidder. When not employed, they make ends meet as highway robbers, forcing merchant caravans to pay protection money."}, {"Combate": "When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and strike with a melee weapon.Captivating Song (Su): The most insidious ability of the harpy is its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy\u2019s song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the monster\u2019s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard\u2019s countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.Skills: Harpies have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Listen checks.Possessions: +3 studded leather, +1 frost composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), 10 cold iron arrows, 10 silvered arrows, 5 +2 arrows, lesser bracers of archery, potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of cat\u2019s grace, cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1.
