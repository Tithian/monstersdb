Each touch drains 6 power points from the opponent (or fewer, if the opponent has fewer than 6 points remaining). Against a nonpsionic creature or a psionic creature that currently has no power points, this touch attack instead deals 1 point of Intelligence damage, which provides nourishment equivalent to 6 power points.A thought eater requires 12 power points per day to survive but will gorge itself on weak prey.Psi-Like Abilities: At will\u2014detect psionics, distract (DC 13), precognition, psionic daze (DC 13*); 3/day\u2014thought shield.Manifester level 3rd.
