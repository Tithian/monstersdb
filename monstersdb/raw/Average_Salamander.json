A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.Heat (Ex): A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders\u2019 metallic weapons also conduct this heat.Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a salamander must hit a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.Skills: Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing) checks.Feats: Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they do not have the requisite three natural weapons."}]
