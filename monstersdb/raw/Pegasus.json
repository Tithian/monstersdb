Caster level 5th.Skills: Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.TRAINING A PEGASUSAlthough intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.Carrying Capacity: A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301\u2013600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601\u2013900 pounds.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Pegasus"}]
