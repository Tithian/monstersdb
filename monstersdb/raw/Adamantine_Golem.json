The DC is Strength-based.Magic Immunity (Ex): An adamantine golem is immune to all magical and supernatural effects.ConstructionAn adamantine golem\u2019s body is sculpted from 45,000 pounds of pure iron and is then polymorphed wished into adamantine (using polymorph any object) (using wish). The golem costs 500,000 gold pieces to create, which includes 25,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 40). The creator must be 30th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 10,000 XP from the creator and requires crushing hand, geas/quest, and wish.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Golem"}]
