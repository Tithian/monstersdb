[{"Nombre": "Hag"}, {"Combate": "Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the individual members.HAG COVEYFrom time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a veil spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as hag eyes (see below).Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day\u2014animate dead, bestow curse (DC 17), control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana (DC 18), polymorph, veil (DC 19), vision. Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must participate.Once per month, a covey that does not have a hag eye can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).Hag EyeA hag eye is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a gem of seeing or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a hag eye is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the hag eye can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A hag eye has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a hag eye deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: HagList of HagsAnnisGreen HagNight HagSea Hag"}]
