The save DC is Charisma-based. This is considered a mind-affecting death effect.

This otherwise is a gaze effect.The gaze cannot affect creatures on the Material Plane while the thought slayer remains ethereal, but it can affect ethereal creatures while the thought slayer is on the Material Plane.Psi-Like Abilities: At will\u2014brain lock (any nonmindless, DC 14*), chameleon, detect psionics, distract (DC 13); 3/day\u2014body adjustment (5d12*), mental barrier (+6 AC, 2 rounds*), mind trap (10 rounds*), precognition, wall walker; 1/day\u2014escape detection.

The ability is otherwise identical to the psionic ethereal jaunt power."}]
