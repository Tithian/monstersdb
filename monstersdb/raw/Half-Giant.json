They gain considerable satisfaction in using these large weapons in combat against their foes.Psi-Like Abilities: 1/day: stomp (DC 10). Manifester level equal to 1/2 HD (minimum 1st). The save DC is Charisma-based.Fire Acclimated (Ex): Half-giants have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all fire spells and effects.Powerful Build (Ex): The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature\u2019s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject\u2019s size category.The half-giant warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8."}]
