This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a \u20132 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare\u2019s vision at all.Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su): These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will.Carrying Capacity: A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301\u2013600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601\u2013900 pounds.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Mare (Folklore)"}]
