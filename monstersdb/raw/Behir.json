The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature\u2019s scales, not for fighting.Behirs speak Common."}, {"Combate": "A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent.
