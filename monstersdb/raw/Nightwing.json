They are all but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they obscure in their passing.A nightwing\u2019s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Aversion to Daylight (Ex): If exposed to natural daylight (not merely a daylight spell), Nightshades take a \u20134 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.Desecrating Aura (Su): All Nightshades give off a 20-foot radius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability works much like a desecrate spell, except that the nightshade\u2019s evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a \u20136 penalty.Magic Drain (Su): A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and shields by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting dispel evil upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a number of days after the attack equal to the caster\u2019s level and the caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.Spell-Like Abilities: At will\u2014contagion (DC 18), deeper darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, unholy blight (DC 18); 3/day\u2014confusion (DC 18), greater dispel magic, hold monster (DC 19), invisibility; 1/day\u2014cone of cold (DC 19), finger of death (DC 21), plane shift (DC 21). Caster level 17th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.Summon Undead (Su): A nightwing can summon undead creatures once per night: 5\u201312 shadows, 2\u20134 greater shadows, or 1 dread wraith. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.Skills: *When hiding in a dark area or flying in a dark sky, a nightwing gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks."}]
