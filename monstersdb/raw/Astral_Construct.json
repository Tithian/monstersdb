As a free action, a construct\u2019s manifester can direct the construct to attack particular enemies, use specific tactics or powers, perform other actions, or do nothing at all. The construct does exactly what its creator directs it to do.An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of ectoplasm with a vaguely humanoid shape, but the manifester can mold or sculpt one according to his or her whim within the limits imposed by the creature\u2019s size. The quality of such \u201cconstruct sculpture\u201d is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check. A result of 10 to 19 creates a creature that is recognizably similar to the desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29 creates a construct that looks like an accurate portrayal of that creature type; a result of 30 or higher creates a construct that looks like a specific individual. No matter how high the Craft (sculpting) check result, though, an astral construct\u2019s appearance can\u2019t hide the otherworldly material from which it is formed.Construct Traits: An astral construct has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigued, exhausted, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired.Special Abilities: Every time an astral construct is created, the manifester can choose to apply one special ability to the construct. When the manifester begins to manifest the astral construct power, he chooses one or more special abilities from a menu of abilities appropriate to that level of astral construct.CREATING AN ASTRAL CONSTRUCTWhen manifesting the astral construct power, the manifester assembles the desired creature from a menu of choices, as specified in the construct\u2019s statistics block. A manifester can always substitute two choices from a lesser menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple selections of the same menu choice do not stack unless the ability specifically notes that stacking is allowed.Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to manifest specific powers as psi-like abilities. Unless using the ability is a free action, an astral construct manifesting such a power does so as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. All such powers have a manifester level equal to the astral construct\u2019s Hit Dice or the creator\u2019s manifester level, whichever is lower.An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat granted by a menu choice.Astral Construct Menu AA manifester creating a 1st-level, 2nd-level, or 3rd-level astral construct can choose one special ability from this menu.Buff (Ex): The astral construct gains an extra 5 hit points.Celerity (Ex): The astral construct\u2019s land speed is increased by 10 feet.Cleave (Ex): The astral construct gains the Cleave feat.Deflection (Ex): The astral construct gains a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class.Fly (Ex): The astral construct has physical wings and a fly speed of 20 feet (average).Improved Bull Rush (Ex): The astral construct gains the Improved Bull Rush feat.Improved Slam Attack (Ex): The astral construct gains the Improved Natural Attack feat.Mobility (Ex): The astral construct gains the Mobility feat.Power Attack (Ex): The astral construct gains the Power Attack feat.Resistance (Ex): Choose one of the following energy types: fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic.
