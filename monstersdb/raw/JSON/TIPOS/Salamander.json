A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.\nHeat (Ex): A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders\u2019 metallic weapons also conduct this heat.\nImproved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a salamander must hit a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.\nSpell-Like Abilities: (Noble salamanders only) 3/day\u2014burning hands (DC 13), fireball (DC 15), flaming sphere (DC 14), wall of fire (DC 16); 1/day\u2014dispel magic, summon monster vII (Huge fire elemental).
