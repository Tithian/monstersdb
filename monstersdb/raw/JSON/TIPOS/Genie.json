If trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and freedom.\nPlane Shift (Sp): A genie can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 13th).\n\nList of Genie\nDjinni\nEfreeti\nJanni\nSEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Djinni\n\n\n"
