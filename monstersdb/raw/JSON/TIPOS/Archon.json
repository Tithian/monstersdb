    "Combate": "\nArchons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).\nArchon Traits: An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature\u2019s entry).\n\nDarkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.\nAura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a \u20132 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon\u2019s aura for 24 hours.\nImmunity to electricity and petrification.\n+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.\nMagic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon\u2019s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon\u2019s statistics block.)\nTeleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.\nTongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.\nList of Archons\nLantern Archon\nHound Archon\nTrumpet Archon\nSEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Archon\n\n\n"
