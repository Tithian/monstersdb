    "Combate": "\nIn combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.\nAngel Traits: An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature\u2019s entry).\n\nDarkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.\nImmunity to acid, cold, and petrification.\nResistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.\n+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.\nProtective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel\u2019s HD). This aura can be dispelled, but the angel can create it again as a free action on its next turn. (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel\u2019s statistics block.)\nTongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel\u2019s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.\nSEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Angel\n\nList of Angels\nAstral Deva\nPlanetar\nSolar\n\n\n"
