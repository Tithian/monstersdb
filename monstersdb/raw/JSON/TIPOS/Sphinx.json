    "Combate": "\nMost sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.\nPounce (Ex): If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.\nRake (Ex): A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx\u2019s description provides its attack bonus and damage.\nSEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Sphinx\n\nList of Sphinx\nAndrosphinx\nCriosphinx\nGynosphinx\nHieracosphinx\n\n\n"
