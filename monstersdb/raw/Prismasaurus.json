Any creature of less than 8 HD that is within 30 feet of the creature is automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any creature within 20 feet of the prismasaurus is randomly struck by one or more rays of light, as determined by the table that accompanies the prismatic spray spell. This effect is as the prismatic spray spell in a 30-foot-radius spread, but is otherwise as cast by a 20th-level caster. The save DC for the prismatic spray effects is 49.Immunities (Su): It is immune to poison, gases, petrification, and mind-affecting attacks.Prismatic Blur (Ex): The reflected and refracted light that constantly surrounds the creature blurs the creature\u2019s outline and makes it difficult to properly target. All melee and ranged attacks against the creature have a 50% miss chance."}]
