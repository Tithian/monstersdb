As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the devourer can merge its form with that of a helpless or dead creature of Small size or larger. The devourer cannot merge its body with that of a creature immune to extra damage from critical hits.When an intellect devourer completes its merging, it psionically consumes the brain of the victim (which kills it if it is not already dead). The devourer can exit the body at any time as a standard action, bursting the victim\u2019s skull and resuming its normal form.After consuming its victim\u2019s brain, an intellect devourer can instead choose to animate the body for up to seven days as if it were the victim\u2019s original brain. The devourer retains its hit points, saving throws, and mental ability scores, as well as its psi-like abilities. It assumes the physical qualities and ability scores of the victim, as if it had used polymorph to assume the victim\u2019s form. As long as the intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows the languages spoken by the victim and very basic information about the victim\u2019s identity and personality, but none of the victim\u2019s specific memories or knowledge.Psi-Like Abilities: At will\u2014cloud mind, compression, detect psionics, ego whip (2d4, DC 16*), empty mind (+5 on Will saves*), in insinuation (three targets, DC 16*); 3/day\u2014body adjustment (2d12*), intellect fortress, painful strike.
