Of course, a gray glutton has to eat\u2014and eat a lot to feed its bulk\u2014so when not on the scent it will attack any living creature. It always breaks off attacks against nonpsionic foes if psionic prey is an option. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). No challenge seems too extreme to it, even if that means bulling into the center of a powerful party of manifesters.Null Psionic Exhalation (Su): As a free action, a gray glutton can breathe forth a cloud of pale blue translucent gas into an adjacent 10-foot cube. The gas is psionically poisonous; the initial damage is 1d4 power points, and the secondary damage is 3d4 power points (Fortitude DC 18 negates). Affected psionic characters and creatures subtract the lost power points from their reserves.The save DC is Constitution-based.Once a gray glutton has used its exhalation, it must wait 4 rounds before it can exhale again."}]
