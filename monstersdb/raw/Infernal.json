Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals standard claw damage, in addition to automatic spell suck damage.Spell Suck (Su): If an infernal bites a foe, the foe loses one of its highest-level prepared spells or one of the spell slots for this day that it has not used.
