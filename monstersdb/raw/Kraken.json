Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of its body.Krakens speak Common and Aquan."}, {"Combate": "Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab and crush with their arms or drag victims into their huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken\u2019s tentacles or arms as if they were weapons. A kraken\u2019s tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is currently grappling a target with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken\u2019s tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the limb\u2019s full normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses both tentacles or three of its arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the kraken must hit with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.Constrict (Ex): A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.Jet (Ex): A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.Ink Cloud (Ex): A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day\u2014control weather, control winds, dominate animal (DC 18), resist energy. Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.Skills: A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Kraken"}]
