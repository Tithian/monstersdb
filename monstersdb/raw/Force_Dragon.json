It can move freely through barriers made of force, such as a wall of force.Deflecting Force (Su): A force dragon is protected by a shield of force that provides a deflection bonus to its AC. The deflection bonus is equal to the dragon\u2019s Charisma bonus.Blur (Su): When a force dragon reaches juvenile age, the force surrounding its body distorts the light around it so that it is hard to discern the dragon\u2019s exact location. This functions as a continuous blur spell, giving the dragon concealment (20% miss chance).Displacement (Su): An old force dragon\u2019s deflecting force bends light even more extremely, giving the dragon the benefit of the displacement spell (50% miss chance). This supersedes its blur ability.Invisibility (Su): A great wyrm force dragon is a creature of pure force, and is completely invisible (as though protected by greater invisibility). A creature that can see invisible creatures must still contend with the dragon\u2019s displacement ability.Spell-Like  3/day\u2014forcecage, maze, resilient sphere, telekinetic sphere, wall of force.
