A covey of lillends usually discusses strategy before a battle.A lillend\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Constrict (Ex): A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.Spells: A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level bard.Typical Bard Spells Known (3/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0\u2014 dancing lights, daze, detect magic, lullaby, mage hand, read magic; 1st\u2014 charm person, cure light wounds, identify, sleep; 2nd\u2014hold person, invisibility, sound burst.Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day\u2014darkness, hallucinatory terrain (DC 18), knock, light; 1/day\u2014charm person (DC 15), speak with animals, speak with plants.
