[{"Nombre": "Brass dragon"}, {"Descripci\u00f3n": "At birth, a brass dragon\u2019s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs."}, {"Combate": "Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon\u2019s thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat.Breath Weapon (Su): A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of sleep. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.Spell-Like Abilities: At will\u2014speak with animals; 3/day\u2014endure elements (juvenile or older; radius 10 ft. x dragon\u2019s age category); 1/day\u2014suggestion (adult or older), control winds (old or older), control weather (ancient or older).Summon Djinni (Sp): This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon, works like a summon monster spell, except that it summons one djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.Skills: Bluff, Gather Information, and Survival are considered class skills for brass dragons.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Dragon"}, {"Columnas": "/Age/Speed/Initiative/AC/SpecialAbilities/CasterLevel/SR", "Fila 1": "/Wyrmling/T/4d12+4(30)/11/10/13/10/11/10/+4/\u20134/+6/+5/+4/+4/1d6(13)/\u2014", "Fila 2": "/Veryyoung/S/7d12+7(52)/13/10/13/10/11/10/+7/+4/+9/+6/+5/+5/2d6(14)/\u2014", "Fila 3": "/Young/M/10d12+20(85)/15/10/15/12/13/12/+10/+12/+12/+9/+7/+8/3d6(17)/\u2014", "Fila 4": "/Juvenile/M/13d12+26(110)/17/10/15/12/13/12/+13/+16/+16/+10/+8/+9/4d6(18)/\u2014", "Fila 5": "/Youngadult/L/16d12+48(152)/19/10/17/14/15/14/+16/+24/+19/+13/+10/+12/5d6(21)/20", "Fila 6": "/Adult/L/19d12+76(199)/23/10/19/14/15/14/+19/+29/+24/+15/+11/+13/6d6(23)/21", "Fila 7": "/Matureadult/H/22d12+110(253)/27/10/21/16/17/16/+22/+38/+28/+18/+13/+16/7d6(26)/24", "Fila 8": "/Old/H/25d12+125(287)/29/10/21/16/17/16/+25/+42/+32/+19/+14/+17/8d6(27)/25", "Fila 9": "/Veryold/H/28d12+168(350)/31/10/23/18/19/18/+28/+46/+36/+22/+16/+20/9d6(30)/28", "Fila 10": "/Ancient/H/31d12+186(387)/33/10/23/18/19/18/+31/+50/+40/+23/+17/+21/10d6(31)/29", "Fila 11": "/Wyrm/G/34d12+238(459)/35/10/25/20/21/20/+34/+58/+42/+26/+19/+24/11d6(34)/32", "Fila 12": "/Greatwyrm/G/37d12+296(536)/37/10/27/20/21/20/+37/+62/+46/+28/+20/+25/12d6(36)/33", "Fila 13": "/Wyrmling/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly150ft.(average)/+0/15(+2size,+3natural),touch12,/flat-footed15/Immunitytofire,/speakwithanimals/,/vulnerability/tocold/\u2014/\u2014", "Fila 14": "/Veryyoung/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly150ft.(average)/+0/17(+1size,+6natural),touch11,/flat-footed17:/\u2014/\u2014/\u2014", "Fila 15": "/Young/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/19(+9natural),touch10,/flat-footed19/\u2014/1st/\u2014", "Fila 16": "/Juvenile/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/22(+12natural),touch10,/flat-footed22/Endureelements/3rd/\u2014", "Fila 17": "/Youngadult/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/24(\u20131size,+15natural),touch9,/flat-footed24/DR5/magic/5th/18", "Fila 18": "/Adult/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/27(\u20131size,+18natural),touch9,/flat-footed27/Suggestion/7th/20", "Fila 19": "/Matureadult/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/29(\u20132size,+21natural),touch8,/flat-footed29/DR10/magic/9th/22", "Fila 20": "/Old/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/32(\u20132size,+24natural),touch8,/flat-footed32/Controlwinds/11th/24", "Fila 21": "/Veryold/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/35(\u20132size,+27natural),touch8,/flat-footed35DR/DR15/magic/13th/25", "Fila 22": "/Ancient/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly200ft.(poor)/+0/38(\u20132size,+30natural),touch8,/flat-footed38/Controlweather/15th/27", "Fila 23": "/Wyrm/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly250ft.(clumsy)/+0/39(\u20134size,+33natural),touch6,/flat-footed39/DR20/magic/17th/28", "Fila 24": "/Greatwyrm/60ft.,burrow30ft.,fly250ft.(clumsy)/+0/42(\u20134size,+36natural),touch6,/flat-footed42/Summondjinni/19th/30"}]
