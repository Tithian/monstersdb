    "Combate": "A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.A nightmare\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Flaming Hooves (Su): A blow from a nightmare\u2019s hooves sets combustible materials alight.Smoke (Su): During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or take a \u20132 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare\u2019s vision at all.Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su): These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will.Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a medium load, 613\u20131,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225\u20131,840 pounds.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Nightmare"
