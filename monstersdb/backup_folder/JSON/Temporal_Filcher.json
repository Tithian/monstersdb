    "Combate": "Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a temporal filcher must hit a creature of Large size or smaller with two claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and uses its time filch ability.Psi-Like Abilities: At will\u2014chameleon, distract (DC 13), psionic dimension door, psionic levitate, wall walker; 3/ day\u2014mental barrier. Manifester level 8th. The save DC is Charisma-based.Time Filch (Su): If a temporal filcher successfully grapples a Large or smaller creature, it latches onto the opponent\u2019s body and shifts 7 minutes forward in time as a free action. Observers (if any) see the temporal filcher and its prey disappear in a shimmer, then reappear 7 minutes later in exactly the orientation and condition they left. For the filcher and its prey, no time passes at all. The victim must succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or be dazed for 1 round from temporal disorientation. The ability is otherwise identical to time hop manifested by an 8th-level manifester."
