All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine\u2014although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor."

    "Combate": "Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.Hive Mind (Ex): All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.A formian worker\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Cure Serious Wounds (Sp): Eight workers together can heal a creature\u2019s wounds as though using the cure serious wounds spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.Make Whole (Sp): Three workers together can repair an object as though using the make whole spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for all three workers."
