    "Combate": "Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell and hearing allow them to notice foes nearby. As a result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone Battleaxes.Blindsight (Ex): Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment.Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence) and overpowering odors (such as stinking cloud or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock\u2019s sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.Immunities: Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.Skills: *A grimlock\u2019s dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground."
