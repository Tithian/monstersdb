They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than zombies.Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.Paralyzing Touch (Su): A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.Create Spawn (Su): Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg\u2019s control. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life."
