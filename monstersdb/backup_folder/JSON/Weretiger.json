It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.Pounce (Ex): If a weretiger in tiger form charges an opponent, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.Tiger Empathy (Ex): Communicate with tigers and dire tigers, and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against tigers and dire tigers.Skills: In any form, weretigers have a +4 bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8 in the tiger form.The weretiger presented here is a 1st-level human warrior and natural lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Werecat"
