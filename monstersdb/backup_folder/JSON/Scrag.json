    "Descripci\u00f3n": "Scrags walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, scrags are very agile.A typical adult scrag stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females are slightly larger than males. A scrag\u2019s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray.Scrags speak Giant."

  {
    "Combate": "Scrags have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without hesitation, flailing wildly at the closest opponent. Even when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack.Rend (Ex): If a scrag hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent\u2019s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.Regeneration (Ex): Fire and acid deal normal damage to a scrag. If a scrag loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump. They regenerate only if mostly immersed in water."
