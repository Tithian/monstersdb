    "Descripci\u00f3n": "Kolyaruts mete out punishment to those who break bargains and oaths.Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut learns as much about the contract or oath as possible. It\u2019s not interested in those who break deals accidentally or against their will\u2014 only those who willingly break contracts violate the principle that kolyaruts are created to uphold. If a written contract was broken, the kolyarut typically carries a copy of the contract with it.Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible attempts at social niceties such as proper greetings before getting down to the matter at hand. They can use disguise self to appear as almost any kind of humanoid\u2014useful if they need to go undercover to catch their quarry."

    "Combate": "Like all inevitables, a kolyarut is patient enough to study a target before striking. It has a good idea of the deal-breaker\u2019s abilities and defenses before it enters battle. When it fights, it tries to get the conflict over as soon as possible, minimizing excess bloodshed and mayhem. It doesn\u2019t let concern for innocents delay or endanger its mission, however.A kolyarut\u2019s favorite tactic is to use invisibility or disguise self to sneak close, then eliminate the quarry with its vampiric touch ability before it can react. A kolyarut has no compunctions about using its vampiric touch ability on allies to increase its own power, if doing so helps it complete its mission.A kolyarut\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Enervation Ray (Su): A kolyarut can fire a black enervation ray at targets within 200 feet. The effect is identical with the enervation spell (caster level 13th).Spell-Like Abilities: At will\u2014discern lies (DC 17), disguise self, fear (DC 17), hold person (DC 16), invisibility, locate creature, suggestion (DC 16); 1/day\u2014hold monster (DC 17), mark of justice; 1/week\u2014 geas/quest. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.Vampiric Touch (Su): As a melee touch attack, a kolyarut can steal life force from its foe, as the vampiric touch spell (caster level 13th).Skills: A kolyarut has a +4 racial bonus on Disguise, Gather Information, and Sense Motive checks."
