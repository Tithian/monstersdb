A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the same round.Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a rast must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.Blood Drain (Ex): A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.Flight (Su): A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move action or an attack action) each round."
