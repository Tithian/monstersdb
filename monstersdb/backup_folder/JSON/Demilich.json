    "Combate": "Trap the Soul (Su): A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a fortitude saving throw (DC 36). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four Energy Drains (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich\u2019s form. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours\u2014at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its fortitude saving throw and is effective against the level loss on a successful save. The DC is Charisma-basedFear Aura (Su): Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or be affected as though by fear as cast by a 21st-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a fortitude save (DC 36) or be permanently paralyzed. remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive.Spells: The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich. This sample demilich was a 21st-level wizard (spells per day: 4/12/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/6/3). The last three spell slots are 10th-level slots and available for 0\u20139th level metamagic spells.Perfect Automatic Still Spell (Ex): A demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures.Spell-Like  At will\u2014alter self, astral projection, greater create undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater dispel magic, harm (usually used to heal itself ), summon monster i\u2013IX, telekinesis, weird; 2/day\u2014greater planar ally. Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster level, but the save DCs are all 36. The DC is Charisma-based.Magic Immunity (Ex): Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A shatter spell affects a demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage normally indicated. A dispel evil spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude save save for half damage). Holy smite spells affect demiliches normally.Phylactery Transference (Su): Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich\u2019s phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply. The sample demilich \u201cwears\u201d bracers of armor +8, headband of intellect +6, pink Ioun stone, ring of wizardry I, ring of protection +2, and gloves of dexterity +2.Undead Traits: Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or Energy Drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.Immunities (Ex): Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.CREATING A DEMILICH\u201cDemilich\u201d is a template that can be added to any lich. It uses all the lich\u2019s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. A demilich\u2019s form is concentrated into a single portion of its original body, usually its skull. Part of the process of becoming a demilich includes the incorporation of costly gems into the retained body part; see Creating Soul Gems, below.Size: Medium-size and Large liches become Diminutive demiliches, Huge liches become Small demiliches, Gargantuan liches become Medium-size demiliches, and Colossal liches become Large demiliches.Hit Dice: As lich.Speed: Replace with fly 180 ft. (perfect) or the lich\u2019s supernatural (not natural) fly speed, whichever is better.AC: The demilich retains the lich\u2019s +5 natural armor bonus and gains an insight bonus equal to AC equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a probable size adjustment to AC.Attack: The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as a bonus on its touch attacks.Damage: The demilich gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its previous lich form (it now uses its entire flying skull to make the touch attack), including paralyzing touch. The demilich\u2019s touch attack uses negative energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living creatures (no saving throw). Liches with other natural attacks lose them.Special Attacks: The demilich retains all the lich\u2019s special attacks and also gains those described below.Trap the Soul (Su): A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a fort=saving throw (DC 10 + demilich\u2019s HD + demilich\u2019s Cha modifier). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four Energy Drains (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich\u2019s form. The gem gleams wickedly for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours\u2014at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone.
