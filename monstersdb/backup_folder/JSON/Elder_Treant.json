    "Combate": "Animate Trees (Sp): An elder treant can animate trees within 500 feet at will, controlling up to six trees at a time. It takes a full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves and fights as a treant in all physical respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the elder treant who animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range.Trample (Ex): An elder treant can trample Gargantuan or smaller creatures for 8d20+40 points of Damage. Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity against the elder treant can attempt a Reflex save (DC 54) to halve the Damage. The save DC is Strength-based.Triple Damage against Objects (Ex): An elder treant that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals triple Damage.Plant Traits: Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.Skills: Elder treants receive skills as though they were fey. *They have a +24 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.Spell-Like  At will\u2014animal messenger, command plants, speak with plants, stone tell; 3/day\u2014mass cure light wounds (plants only), plant growth, sunburst, wall of thorns; 1/day\u2014shambler.
