It often jumps onto a creature larger than itself.Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a dire lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.Pounce (Ex): If a dire lion charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +12 melee, damage 1d6+3.Skills: Dire lions have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.*In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Lion"
