When slain, the hoary hunter is actually transported, with its mount, back to the fey realm, where it is resurrected. The only way to truly slay the hoary hunter is to defeat it in its home realm after this epic spell has been exhausted for the day.Hoary SteedA hoary steed\u2019s natural weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Air Walk (Su): A hoary steed can ride through the air as well as on the ground, as though affected by a permanent air walk spell.Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su): These abilities function just like the spells of the same names as cast by a 20th-level caster.Magic Circle Against Good (Su): This ability continuously duplicates the effects of the spell. A hoary steed cannot suppress this ability.Misty Breath (Su): The breath of a hoary steed functions like a constant obscuring mist spell.Immunities (Ex): A hoary steed is immune to all charm and hold spells or abilities.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Horse"
