    "Combate": "Nixies rely on their charm person ability to deter enemies, entering combat only to protect themselves and their territory.Charm Person (Sp): A nixie can use charm person three times per day as the spell (caster level 4th). Those affected must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be charmed for 24 hours. Most charmed creatures are used to perform heavy labor, guard duty, and other onerous tasks for the nixie community. Shortly before the effect wears off, the nixie escorts the charmed creature away and orders it to keep walking. The save DC is Charisma-based.Amphibious (Ex): Although nixies are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.Water Breathing (Sp): Once per day a nixie can use water breathing as the spell (caster level 12th). Nixies usually bestow this effect on those they have charmed.Wild Empathy (Ex): This ability works like the druid\u2019s wild empathy class feature, except that a nixie has a +6 racial bonus on the check.Skills: A nixie has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *Nixies have a +5 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Nix"
