    "Combate": "Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use magic in fights, since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but dwarven clerics throw themselves into battle as heartily as their fellow warriors). If they have time to prepare, they may build deadfalls or other traps involving stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also use warhammers, picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces.A psionic duergar does not possess the spell-like abilities of standard duergars. Instead, it has psi-like abilities.Psi-Like Abilities: 1/day\u2014expansion, invisibility. These abilities are as the power (or spell) manifested by a psion (or sorcerer) of the duergar\u2019s Hit Dice (minimum 3rd level) and affect only the duergar and whatever he carries."
