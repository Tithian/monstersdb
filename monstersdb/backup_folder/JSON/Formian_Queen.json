The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send instructions to and get reports from any formian within her range.She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds.The queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with any creature telepathically."

    "Combate": "Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.Hive Mind (Ex): All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.The queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her enormous bulk to where she needs to go. This sort of occurrence is very rare, however, and most of the time the queen remains within her well-defended chambers.Despite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells and use spell-like abilities to great effect in her own defense as well as the defense of the hive-city.Spells: The queen casts arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/4, base save DC 15 + spell level): 0\u2014acid splash, arcane mark, daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st\u2014comprehend languages, identify, mage armor, magic missile, shield; 2nd\u2014 hypnotic pattern, invisibility, protection from arrows, resist energy, scorching ray; 3rd\u2014dispel magic, heroism, nondetection, slow; 4th\u2014 confusion, detect scrying, black tentacles, scrying; 5th\u2014cone of cold, dismissal, teleport, wall of force; 6th\u2014analyze dweomer, geas/quest, repulsion; 7th\u2014summon monster vii, vision, waves of exhaustion; 8th\u2014prismatic wall, temporal stasis.Spell-Like Abilities: At will\u2014calm emotions (DC 17), charm monster (DC 19), clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect chaos, detect thoughts, dictum (DC 22), divination, hold monster (DC 20), magic circle against chaos, order\u2019s wrath (DC 19), shield of law (DC 23), true seeing.
