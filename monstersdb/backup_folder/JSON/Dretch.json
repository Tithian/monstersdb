In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons are present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches\u2019 fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear of death.A dretch\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day\u2014scare (DC 12), stinking cloud (DC 13). Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.Summon Demon (Sp): Once per day a dretch can attempt to summon another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.Telepathy (Su): Dretches can communicate telepathically with creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal."
