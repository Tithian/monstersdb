It takes joy in burning the creatures and objects of the Material Plane to ashes.Burn (Ex): A fire elemental\u2019s slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental\u2019s flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental\u2018s slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The save DC varies with the elemental\u2019s size (see the table below). A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. The save DC is Constitution- based.Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the elemental\u2019s attack, and also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save."
