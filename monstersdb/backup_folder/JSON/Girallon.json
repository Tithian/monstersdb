    "Descripci\u00f3n": "Girallons are savage, magical cousins of the gorilla. When moving on the ground, a girallon walks on its legs and lower arms. An adult girallon is about 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs about 800 pounds."

    "Combate": "A solitary girallon usually conceals itself in the branches of a tree or under a pile of leaves and brush, with only its nose showing. When it spots or scents prey, it charges to the attack. A girallon picks up prey that is small enough to carry and withdraws, often vanishing into the trees before the victim\u2019s companions can do anything to retaliate. Against larger foes, a girallon seeks to tear a single opponent to bits as quickly as it can.Rend (Ex): A girallon that hits with two or more claw attacks latches onto the opponent\u2019s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d4+12 2d4+9 points of damage.Skills: A girallon has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened."
