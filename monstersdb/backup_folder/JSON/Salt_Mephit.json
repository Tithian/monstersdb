The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.Spell-Like Abilities: Once per hour a salt mephit can use glitterdust (DC 14, caster level 3rd).Once per day it can draw the moisture from an area in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Living creatures within range take 2d8 points of damage (Fortitude DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This effect is especially devastating to plant creatures and aquatic creatures, which take a \u20132 penalty on their saving throws. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.Fast Healing (Ex): A salt mephit heals only if in an arid environment."
