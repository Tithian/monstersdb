In the outdoors, it often uses its powerful wings to stay aloft during battle.Spikes (Ex): With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour period.Skills: *Manticores have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.SEE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY: Manticore"
