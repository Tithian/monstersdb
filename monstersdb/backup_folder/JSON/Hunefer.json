The DC is Charisma-based.Hunefer Rot (Su): Supernatural disease\u2014slam, Fortitude save (DC 35), incubation period instantaneous; Damage 1d6 temporary Con. Unlike normal diseases, hunefer rot requires a victim to make a successful saving throw every round or take another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution Damage. The rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic. An afflicted creature that dies shrivels away into sand unless both remove disease and raise dead (or better) are cast on the remains within 2 rounds. If the remains are not so treated, on the third round the dust swirls and forms an 18 HD mummy with the dead foe\u2019s equipment under the hunefer\u2019s command.
