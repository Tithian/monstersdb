    "Descripci\u00f3n": "Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the same color. Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair their garments, preferring to simply add more hides as their old ones wear out.Adults are about 10-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old."

Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs.Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 120 feet for a hill giant\u2019s thrown rocks."
