    "Combate": "A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the spiked chains that serve as its clothing, armor, and weapons.A chain devil\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Dancing Chains (Su): A chain devil\u2019s most awesome attack is its ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a chain devil can increase these chains\u2019 length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the devil itself. If a chain is in another creature\u2019s possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devil\u2019s power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the creature\u2019s possession. The save DC is Charisma-based.A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks.Unnerving Gaze (Su): Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A chain devil can make its face resemble one of an opponent\u2019s departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves take a \u20132 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.Regeneration (Ex): Chain devils take normal damage from silvered weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with the good descriptor. A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in 2d6x10 minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump enables it to reattach instantly.Skills: Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks involving metalwork."
