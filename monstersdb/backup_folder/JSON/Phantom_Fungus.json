    "Descripci\u00f3n": "This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among subterranean inhabitants."

A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed.Skills: A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks."
