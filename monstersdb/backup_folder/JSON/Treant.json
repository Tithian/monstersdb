    "Descripci\u00f3n": "A treant\u2019s leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant\u2019s legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree.A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a \u201ctrunk\u201d about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues\u2014at least enough to say \u201cGet away from my trees!\u201d"

  {
    "Combate": "Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.Animate Trees (Sp): A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.Double Damage against Objects (Ex): A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.Trample (Ex): Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strength-based. Skills: *Treants have a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas."
