    "Descripci\u00f3n": "An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of Air. By twisting its body and varying the cadence of its wingbeats, an arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction. A juvenile arrowhawk (1 to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long from beak to tail, with the body accounting for about one-third of that length. Its wingspan is about 7 feet, and it weighs about 20 pounds. An adult (11 to 40 years old) is about 10 feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet and a weight of about 100 pounds. An elder arrowhawk (41 to 75 years old) is about 20 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and a weight of about 800 pounds.Arrowhawks speak Auran, but they are not usually talkative creatures."

    "Combate": "Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of reach.Electricity Ray (Su): An arrowhawk can fire this ray once per round, with a range of 50 feet."
