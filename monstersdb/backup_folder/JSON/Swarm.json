    "Combate": "In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents\u2019 spaces, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a creature with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of opportunity, but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is shapeable. It can occupy any four contiguous squares, and it can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of its component creatures.Vulnerabilities of SwarmsSwarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks. However, they have a few special vulnerabilities, as follows:A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of fire damage per hit.A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals its full energy damage with each hit, even if the weapon\u2019s normal damage can\u2019t affect the swarm.A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it breaks.Types of SwarmsBat SwarmCentipede SwarmHellwasp SwarmLocust SwarmRat SwarmSpider Swarm"
