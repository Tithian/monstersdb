    "Combate": "In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.Detect Thoughts (Su): A rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.Spells: A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level): 0\u2014detect magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st\u2014charm person, mage armor, magic missile, shield, silent image; 2nd\u2014bear\u2019s endurance, invisibility, acid arrow; 3rd\u2014haste, suggestion.Change Shape (Su): A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals its natural form.Skills: A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. *When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent\u2019s mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4."
