    "Combate": "When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and slaughter them while they can\u2019t fight back.A nalfeshnee\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Smite (Su): Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One round later they burst in a 60-foot radius.

The creature receives its full Dexterity and shield bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.Spell-Like Abilities: At will\u2014call lightning (DC 18), feeblemind (DC 20), greater dispel magic, slow (DC 18), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), unholy aura (DC 23).

This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.True Seeing (Su): Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).Skills: Nalfeshnees have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks."
