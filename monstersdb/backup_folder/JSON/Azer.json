    "Combate": "Azers use broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in combat. When unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes.Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a fight except to relieve a foe of gems, which they love. If threatened, they fight to the death, but they see the value of taking prisoners themselves.Heat (Ex): An azer\u2019s body is intensely hot, so its unarmed attacks deal extra fire damage. Its metallic weapons also conduct this heat."
