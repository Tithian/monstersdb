    "Combate": "Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the transgressor they\u2019ve been assigned to, ignoring other combatants completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress, but it won\u2019t tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with deadly force in return.An inevitable\u2019s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.Fast Healing (Ex): An inevitable healss a certain amount of damage each round (specified in each variety\u2019s description) as long as it has at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.List of InevitableKolyarutMarutZelekhut"
